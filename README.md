# Anime Guessing Game

A fun **Wordle-Type** game where your goal is to guess the anime within 5 tries for each section.

## Features

- **Guessing Rules**: All guesses must be lowercase and without spaces, using the full name of the anime.

## Usage
1. Use the input at the top to guess.
2. The audio has controls so use them if you need to play it back.
3. If you don't know any animes and want to test out the functionality of the game, find the answers in the `Credits` file within the `DONTREAD(ANSWERS)` folder.
