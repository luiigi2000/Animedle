This is a wordle type game where your goal is to guess the anime given within 5 tries for each section. The first section is picture guessing. The anime image begins very blurred and every guess you make unblurs it slightly till its fully unblurred. You cant guess if its fully unblurred. The second section is openings based and you have to guess which anime the intro belongs to. Every guess you make increases the play time slightly of the intro. There are only two current sections so your final score is based off how many attempts it takes you out of 10. There are currently 10 animes in game to guess from. IMPORTANT: guesses must be all lowercase without spaces with mainstream name of anime. If you dont watch anime and want to know the functionality of the website/game, the animes used are in the credits folder. Dont forget that this is the first website I have ever made. Thankyou for playing!
